# Omics-interaction-interkingdom-networks-in-R
This R code shows how you can plot correlation networks of  important OMICS feartures. You can select important OMICS features of multiple kingdomes using DIABLO as i have uploded in the repository. Assuming you have already perform spearman or pearson correlation among selected features, Remove intrakingdom correlations, only keep interkingdom. I have provided 2 code scripts, one for correlation networks between two kingdome and one for correlation networks between three kingdoms. in exapmle code i have 3 kingdomes human, fungus and bateria so i have 3 correlation tables Human_fungus, Human_bactria and Fungus_bactria. Make datasets in such a way that first column in each correlation table is diffent. for example: if column 1 of Human_fungus has human features, human_bacteria should have bateria features and fungus_bacteria should have fungus features. I will update this repository with result figures and tables after publications.
